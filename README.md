# Adult_HSPC_Differentiation_Migration_2023
Abstract
Hematopoiesis requires the coordinated differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in multiple tissues. Although differentiation of HSPCs in bone marrow (BM) has been well-studied, our knowledge about the migration and differentiation of HSPCs cross tissues is limited. Here, we collected and integrated single-cell RNA-seq data of human CD34+ cells, which represent HSPCs, from BM, peripheral blood (PB), thymus and mobilized PB (mPB), to investigate the hematopoiesis cross tissues. We constructed a cell atlas of HSPCs cross tissues and found most HSPC subsets in BM had counterparts in PB, indicating migration of HSPCs from BM to PB has a much broad spectrum. We found B progenitors highly expressed CXCR4 for anchoring in BM, while cells with low expression of CXCR4 facilitate their migration out of BM. Among the HSPC subsets from thymus, we only found the counterparts of the earliest thymic progenitors (ETPs) in BM and PB, potentially indicating that ETPs were the subsets that migrated from BM to PB and thymus. We found interaction signaling including CD99-CD99, CXCL12-CXCR4 and CCL19-CCR7 played important roles in ETP homing to thymus. Briefly, these data provided a single unified developmental spectrum of hematopoiesis cross different tissues, connected by cell migration. 

Here are code for analysis: The "HSPC_analysis.r" show the code to analyze healthy human HSPCs cross tissues and the "MF_analysis"
 show the code to analyze MF HSPCs.
